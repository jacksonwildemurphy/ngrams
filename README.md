# N-gram language models for assigning statistical probabilities to sentences

Given a training model (.txt file of sentences), this program generates 3 language models (unigram, bigram, and bigram with Laplacian smoothing). 

These 3 language models are used to generate probabilities of arbitrary sentences supplied in a test file

## Usage
`$ python ngrams.py <training_file> -test <test_file>`
